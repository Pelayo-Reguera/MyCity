## What's MyCity is?
MyCity is a mobile application created to awake the interest of citizens from a locality. Its main purpose is to encourage inhabitants to attend events promoted by their city hall :bank:. To achieve this objective the following basic features will be implemented :wrench:
- [ ] People will be able to follow other accounts 👥
- [ ] Only city halls or those small organizations can post events in the app ✍️
- [ ] 
- [ ] There will be a points remuneration system 🪙 consisting of:
  - [ ] Rewarding people who attend to the events with these points 😁
  - [ ] Rewarding those who participate in the activities that optionally organizers can post in their own created events. 🖐️
  - [ ] The public can spend these points in whatever the organizers offer (for example merchandising, their next events...)
