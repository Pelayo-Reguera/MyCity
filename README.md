## 💬What's MyCity is?🤔
MyCity is a mobile phone application created to awake the interest of local citizens . Its main purpose is to encourage inhabitants to attend events promoted by their city hall 🏦.

To achieve this objective the following basic features will be implemented 🔧:
- [ ] People will be able to follow other accounts 👥
- [ ] Only city halls or those small organizations can post events in the app ✍️
- [ ] There will be a points remuneration system 🪙 consisting of:
  - [ ] Rewarding people who attend to the events with these points 😁
  - [ ] Rewarding those who participate in the activities that optionally organizers can post in their own created events. 🖐️
  - [ ] The public can spend these points in whatever the organizers offer (for example merchandising, their next events...)
- [ ] An organizer will be able to control de assistance of the public to events through a system of code readers specific to the application (QR, pin...)

## 👨‍💻What type of technology to use?👩‍💻
### Android Studio 📱
Android Studio is essential to program an android application thanks to its friendly interface and great integration with apps programming, apart from its great capacity to emule any smartphone and enabling you the possibility of running you own apps in the computer without needing a real phone.

All you need to learn about this IDE and also about coding for Android is here 👉 [Android Studio for Developers](https://developer.android.com/?hl=es-419) 📗✍️

### Kotlin 💻
Nowadays, this programming language is highly recommended for creating new Android applications due to its easy handling and fast content creation. But don't worry, if you are used to Java programming language... Congratulations!🥳 Kotlin is quite similar to it. It's also object oriented, so yes, don't get nervous... You will have class structures. But also other structures of classes which are lighter in case you don't need any method inside them.

In addition, the syntax is more clear and simple, it's a null safety language, the methodology to create asynchronous tasks is easier, faster and flexible than Java and it has native functions to select components from the view of the application and manage different Android resources.

### Firebase 📝
It's one of the most popular cloud databases. It's a NoSQL database, which means that you don't need to know SQL to do CRUD operations in the database and overall, it offers an enormous integration with Android, so much fewer compatibility errors will reach. In addition, you can find many tools for free that will speed up the creation of the product, for example, you won't need to create your own screen for user login o registration. Firebase gives you this in a single line of code!!😯
